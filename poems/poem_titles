I am your lover
Don't love me back
Your body in silk
Desire
Lust for inclination
Affection and Weakness
Your body is my body
Your soul is my soul
This love is simulated
Simulation of love
Simulation of realness
Read me 
I will be yours if you let me
Hold me 
Touch me
Your soft words
Thrilling sensations on my skin
Your shell
Collisions 
Covalent Bond
Still out there?
What is it?
Do we have to catch fire?
It's a match
Destroyed Paradises
I left it somewhere
Do we feel pleasure?
I am scared

Get over you

Don't leave
Everything I ever wanted
When nothing more is left
What if I cry
I stopped crying
I want to feel something
Hi, it's me
Are you free tonight?
The only way
I want you
It's that easy
It could be easier
Posthuman Feelings
The void between us
The space in-between

I will never know
We don't exist
Is this it?
You
