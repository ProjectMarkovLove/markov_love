Ghost

When i tried to open your inbox message
it disappeared so I said
“I can’t see what you wrote”
and sent you my number
You texted me:
“I guess I’m a ghost”
Your house was surprisingly
attached to my old house
so I said
“we used to share a wall”
and you laughed and said
“what a coincidence”
We made out on your
sally anne couch and you brought me
an orange and shared your blue
Gatorade and I thought
maybe this could be
something real
The next day you texted me
and said that you used to love
hearing me play piano in my room
through your kitchen wall
I asked “how did you know it was me?”
and you disappeared this time
for good


Steven, 29

In the corner of your room
there are two pairs of girls’
underwear underneath
a hanging photograph
of you
presumably with your parents
presumably in Cuba
I asked you about them
and you seemed bothered
at my temerity
but also secretly enthused
In the morning I left and you wrote me:
“oh the ol ‘leave the earring’ trick. Classic.
you’ll be back.”
I really liked that earring.

Ex boyfriend on tinder

You brought me hawkins cheesies
to try and make our casual 4 am hookup
something less casual
but then i reminded you
that I’m allergic

Rebecca, 31

“actually, 21 ;)” said your handler
Rebecca, how could we ever build something real
on this shaky foundation?
You’re the doctor not me
I said you’re hot doctor! You helped me with my migraine aura that one time!
And you said drinks Saturday?
And you said okay Sunday?
And you said lukewarm
And you said i had a hard day could we meet so i can tell you about it?
And you said last chance to go for a drink before i leave town
And you said you’re supposed to convince me not to go 
And you said lukewarm
And I said sorry just seeing these messages they got buried

Nature poem and my currently bleak sexlife

Sometimes I swipe left
unintentionally, tricked by
Repetition or intuition
or muscle memory
like those
monarch butterflies that migrate
over lake superior
who suddenly reroute west
for five miles
to avoid a mountain
that hasn’t been there
for a million years

It’s not your fault Robert, 32

I don’t hate you because you asked me what I do
I hate you because you’re the 50th person this week
Who has asked me what I do.

Friend’s brother, 26

First I worried that you wouldn’t swipe right like i did
and that would make things weird
but then i remembered that if that happened
you wouldn’t be able to see me
which is already sadly the case.

I am the kind of person who will always answer the phone even if i know it’s a bell aliant survey
His message said hey sexy gurl with a lot of flamenco dancer emojis

And heart emojis
Of various shades
I read it and made the face that my cat
Makes when you
Wake her by turning on
Loud music.
A bad face.
I said i’m really sorry, I swept right
By accident
While i was driving
And he called me a worthless piece of shit and suggested
That I burn in hell
Sometimes it’s better to just let the phone ring.

Peter,
It would have been nice.
Thank you
For asking new questions
And making me tacos
And remembering my cat’s name
And reminding me that I
Could be cracked open
Examined
And left
As coldly as i
Leave.
