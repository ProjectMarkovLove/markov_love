THE RIGHT TIME, THE RIGHT WAY

I needed someone—
I needed someone special;
My eyes lay upon your face—
In anticipation but doubt;
I was so touched by the softness of your eyes,
The grace of your stance,
The peacefulness of your temperament;
Your presence responded to my need and wish;
You came to me,
At the right time;
You came to me,
In the right way.

SPEAK TO ME OF LOVE AND MORE

When I first looked at you,
I saw something special;
I saw something special
With you, in you, and between us.
When I first looked at you, I felt something special;
When I first looked at you, I was special—
We were special.
So answer me and strip free
The truth of your presence coming;
Is your image the echo of my ideal?
Speak to me of such and more:
Through eyes bright like candles’ glow
And unarming smiles of coy around the
Tenderness of lips so virgin and pure;
Through natural beauty untouched by
False disguise and spiritual energy so
Flowing to the talents of your future’s call;
Through the life of movement so confident
Yet modestly unartificial and true.
Speak to me of such by more:
Is this first parting’s sweetness a passing
Dream to keep?
Is it the inspiration of the Inspirer’s design
To know you once in passing, or will privilege
Be destiny’s desire to look once more upon the 
Light of your lovely face aglow and budding
Energy in flow?
Speak to me sweet flower, and pray
By chance to smell once more the fragrance
Of your presence, and feel once more the
Vibrancy of your natural way.
Be it friendship or more;
Or a spiritual passing of two destined souls
Who love the world so much so as to want so
Much to give of ourselves to that world
Through the gift of ourselves to each other.

I FEEL I’VE KNOWN YOU

Sometimes I feel I’ve been in another world;
Sometimes I feel I know there’s a world beyond;
Sometimes I feel I’ve stood in this space with you;
This space and moment of today in our first
Meeting of eyes—
Without a word, I knew I knew you as I had before;
I knew I wanted you as I did before;
I knew I wanted you and had to have you
As much as I fought my feelings for you,
And you—yours for me.
So come quietly to me in peace and burning
Desire, and let me receive you around me as one;
I’ve waited long across lifetimes for your face
In the parade of many—
Come let us savor the souls of our many lives
Before, and fulfill the destiny of our
Long-lasting desires;
Come to our dining to feast first upon the spirit
Of each other’s energy;
Face your face to mine in sweet teasing of
Dessert’s patient waiting;
Rush not the sacred sensuality of our prolonged
Romance asleep;
Come, come, come my love.

FIRST GLIMPSE, FIRST DANCE

The first glimpse of your face
Took the light of my eyes deep to
The core of your countenance;
To know as you knew that we both
Were made and sent for each other.
At first touch of you, I knew you were
Sculpted to my arms’ embrace as we
Glided as one in musical magic’s
Movement to the body’s call of our
Bemused spirits’ wish.
So effortlessly and pleasurably we
Danced as playful birds suspended in
Flight and to life’s breathing of our
Energies real and memories sealed.
Thanks for the dance sweet lady,
And permit me to hold you once more
To our own spiritual rhythm and to
A music that is unending.

WILL YOU COME WITH ME?

I have sought your image
Without knowledge of your existence,
My ideal woman you are;
So come with me please—
Be with me and share your life;
Create life we will, and together
We’ll be trustees of another;
Come with me and I will pick a red hibiscus
For your hair and the sweet magnolia flower
As your perfume’s fragrance;
I’ll promise nothing except to be with you
And be for you as long as we live
Under the watchful eyes of the stars.

ROMANTICA

Again, we meet in the common air of
Our private space—to breathe, I hope, the
Anticipation of love’s possible excitement
From this serene peace; your fresh flower
Has sprung from youth’s tender bud, so
Luring to the patience of my long wait and
The wisdom of my awaited patience.
With face to the light of you, I fix my
Energy to the spirit of your field; so
Wanting to be with you, to touch with eyes
And arms but not too soon so as to spoil
The pleasure of our precious urgings and
Restrained glee.
Let not your presentation of reservation
Betray future’s life of a whole love of two—
Of a spiritual union destined for the divine
Creation of love’s life from our shared bond,
Our priceless oneness, our future hopes,
Our sensual moments of untempered desire.
Come with me, be with me, romance with me,
And let our eternal love be an unending evening
Of special things shared—of sparkling drink with
Rhythmical dance, of musical tunes under many
Full moons, of colorful flowers and pastel towels,
Of tender touch and vacations much.
Come with me to the sacred temple, or simply
Stand with me under God’s old oak tree;
Allow me to veil your face under the purest
Lace to the slight peek of your shining eyes
And the sweet gentle reach of your life’s breath—
Yes, be my wife, be with me in this special
Moment of ceremony, and touch tenderly and
Ever slowly your lips upon mine; to seal
Evermore the energy of our romantic union
And precious love.
Go patiently we will in the wind of destiny’s call
And with sweet memories of dreams made true;
Create we will a life of two or more—
With shared fortunes and misfortunes, with
Cherished joys and borne pains, and with a
Love unyielding to life’s tests of time and a
Romance that will never die.
Let me come with you, be with you, and
Stay with you my lady; let our love anew grow
And pierce deep within our souls an untarnished
Commitment and an unbroken peace;
Let our lasting love scream forth in silent truth
Our romance forevermore to all the universe
In the sacred message of:
ROMANTICA, ROMANTICA, ROMANTICA!

And hold sacred your life and welfare as long as we
Choose and hold each other;

You will do likewise with me;
With this, my head, I will think of you wherever I am
And whenever I can as thoughts of concern for you and
Shared experiences with you.

To help minimize your pains and maximize your happiness,
To forgive you for inadvertent errors of human frailty,

Neither will I allow myself to be blinded by false
Feelings for another or life’s many luring excitements;
I will talk with you, walk with you, and persevere with you
Through tests of time and condition;
I will pray with you, hope with you, struggle with you,
And suffer with you in your hardships;
Most of all, I will love you, without condition, for as long
As I can and as long as you want me to—
Hoping and trusting it will be forever.

OUR HOLIDAY

‘Tis a cultural holiday of celebration;
But it matters not the differences
Of our worlds apart;
For celebrate we must on this
Merry day of glee—our love,
Ourselves;
‘Tis not your holiday,
‘Tis not my holiday,
But our holiday—
‘Tis a special time for special people
To love and celebrate happiness.

LET US WRITE A SCRIPT IN OUR HEARTS

Let us write a script in our hearts,
And let us play it out from
Moment to moment in spontaneity;
Let our needs be felt and realized,
Our drives reduced,
Our anxieties subdued,
Our depression minimized;
Let us enjoy our others and
The worlds around us as we encounter;
Let us enjoy our own selves;
Let us eat, rest, explore, and talk
In the presence of each other’s
Comfort, good company, and security;
Let us write a script from moment to moment
In our hearts and
In our lives.

WE SAW WITHIN EACH OTHER’S EYES

We sat alone,
We drank wine,
We intellectualized about nothing.
Then we saw within each other’s eyes
The nature of our true being,
Then we realized our gender,
Then we communicated our nonverbal
Desire to move toward our other.
Our instruments of vision touched in softness
Suppressing our eagerness,
Our tools of manipulation searched
The pleasures of our curiosities,
We slowly lost the control of our rational
Being to the passion of our desires,
We shed ourselves of that which hid our
True selves from the honey of each other’s fruits.

Can I be free with you—
And not have to rush anything,
And not have to prove anything,
And not have to be anything?
Can I be me, and you be you?
Can we be we, can we be one,
Can we be free?

LET ME LOVE YOU IN THE MORNING OF YOUR WOMANHOOD

If you let me come into your heart,
I will do wonders with the clay of your
Parents’ making;
Let me touch you in the morning years
Of your womanhood, and make you
The better lady you must eventually be;
As I must, let me hold your heart next to
Mine and stroke your contour to fineness;
Let the warmth of your deepest breath
Massage the perceptiveness of my ear,
That I may feel your life grow in my arms,
And that I may live again through the
Life of your love;
Let me love you in the morning of your
Womanhood, that you may become the
Lady of my night for all occasions
And all times.

FINE WOMAN

Fine woman of svelte neck, straight back,
And sturdy hips—let me
Watch your stance and poised presence
Among others; let me breathe the energy
Of your elegant space.
Fine woman of creamy texture and
Tanned hue, I secretly watch you—and
Patiently await my turn of acquaintance,
To feel the peace of your calm temperament
And visualize up close the form of your
Lovely essence.
Speak to me, speak with me, and let my
Total attention for you be yours on this
Special night of ours. Let us dine under
The stars of this resort and smile for each
Other as night grows old to morning’s birth;
Let us breathe of each other’s air, and be
One in the moment of our private selves
And space.

MEANING OF ROMANTIC LOVE

Romantic love is two dynamos that turn on and
Feed into each other;
It is total energy directed toward another that
Makes one oblivious to time and space;
Romantic love is that emotion that contradicts and
Obfuscates rationality, reality, and responsibility;
It is that acted-out fantasy realized for the moment
And hoped for forever;
Romantic love is two persons alone in the universe
Who prize each other’s presence and consume
Each other’s essence for every moment and in
Every good way;
It is the visceral excitement that compels the
Fulfillment of one’s capacity for sensuality,
Sensitivity, and possibility;
Romantic love is that ecstatic, good feeling that
Provides a secure feeling, enhances worldly
Appreciation, promotes confidence, and overhauls
Physical and psychological health;
It is the force that drives people out of their skin,
Pushes them to a higher level of emotional
Realization, and overpowers human control;
Romantic love is giving for the joy of giving, sharing
For the sake of sharing, and enjoying each other
For the pleasure of each other.

A PHONE CALL’S WAIT

I’ve lived today in wake—
From morn to night this date,
Just to hear your voice once more
Across the miles;
I’ve anticipated the breath of
Your energy’s space to make my
Day by phone, to complete my
Night hitherto alone—with exciting
Thoughts of you;
I’ve lived this day in wait for
Your call of tone’s ring of phone
Here alone;
I’ve lived all day just to hear the
Breath and sigh of your sweet
Voice for me;
I’ve lived all day, in my patient
Way, just to hear you say,
“I love you.”

OUR LAST NIGHT TOGETHER
On a moonlit night, we stood
Under the privacy of a backyard tree,
Never once with the courage to explore the pit
Of our youthful volcanic desires on this last night;
We stood and stood in caress on the eve
Of the moving truck’s coming, and counted
So painfully our last minutes of evening,
Ever together;
She placed her miniature cross and chain in my hand
As a symbol of remembrance; only to watch me
Clutch passionately before losing it to my jeans’s pocket;
One last hug, one last fumbling kiss
As her father called, “bedtime”;
Reluctantly, she walked away, shielding
The treacherous door from the night light’s torment;
I remember dearly, her back showed well in the moonlight
As she turned to give me the last image of her face.

WE WALKED

Our shoes powdered themselves
In the sun-beaten earth along the
Side of the road, as we strolled so
Closely to ourselves while oblivious
To school peers.
She 13 and I 15, as innocent and shy,
Yet so aware but resisting of feelings
Awakened by maturity and our own
Simple attraction to the sweetness
Of each other’s flower.
Not yet a kiss or thought of else as
We touched our other’s voice and face
With ears so tuned and eyes so focused
Within the range of our own youthful
Company.
Parted we daily did to sweet evening
Memories of an afternoon walk so
Much anticipated upon each morning’s
Wakening.

LOVE ME NOT WITH WORDS ONLY

Great, how sweet the sound of your voice
In accolade and promise,
The twinkle and glitter of your mirror’s eye
Complement the timbre of your utterance,
Your vibrations bring warm news to my ear,
Good news I like to hear,
But oh how transient the sounds, though sweet;
Love me not with words only,
But with your good deeds;
Let me know that you care for me—
Through action, effort, and sacrifice;
Let us share time, let us eat—
Eat under the shade of a summer’s tree,
Dance in the spotlight of the public’s eye,
Hold hands in strides of step and time;
Let us care for our lives and even that of another;
Let us work together, plan together, play together,
Laugh together, meditate together, sacrifice
Together, hurt together, and feel good together;
Love me with your complete feelings, actions, and
Thoughts,
And love me not with words only.

I’M GLAD I MET YOU

Gee, I’m glad I met you;
Together, we have made each other better;
We have shared each other,
And have realized our sensations;
We have experienced reality,
And have grown together in knowledge;
We have encountered each other’s worlds,
And have mutually shared our feelings;
Our joys have been increased and our pain
Minimized by the mere presence of our other;
Gee, I’m glad I met you;
Let us remember all the good and pleasant things
We have shared together,
And let us reserve a space in each other’s
Heart for all those special moments and memories.

LET US MAKE MEMORIES

Let us make memories that we
Can prize forever;
Let us make them in our minds
Of spontaneous and planned
Experiences of ourselves—
In all Earth’s seasons and glorious
Splendor.
In spring or fall, in the park or
By the waterfront, let us breathe
Our existence within the energy of
Romantic thoughts, feelings, and
Surrounding.
Let us make memories that we
Can appreciate now but treasure
Always in our minds and hearts.

WILL YOU ROW IN MY BOAT?

Come sit in my boat at morn
When the mist of fog shields the
Privacy of precious romances, and the
Coolness of dawn preserves the
Goodness and innocence of virgin loves.
Come sit with your face to mine
And let the bashful, gleaming sun’s light
Reveal the pristine beauty of your
Lovely eyes and skin aglow.
Come sit with me and row with me,
And let our love afloat gently disturb
My favorite flowered dress of our
First acquaintance.

I LONG FOR YOU

Please, relax now,
I long not for the revelation
Of the privacy of your temple,
But for the company of the
Whole of you; to be with you,
Anytime and anywhere.
I long for your respect, for the
Energy of your existence to make
Me the better for your most
Worthy appreciation and happiness.
Please now, know my cause and motive,
For they are true to you;
Sincerely, I long for your heart,
Your soul, your inspiration, your
Presence, your natural warmth.

NOSTALGIA I

When the night light was bright,
We stood underneath looking at our feet;
You touched me—oh so gently with your breath,
And I felt within me a leap of warmth
Corralled by my own tremor of shyness.
When the night light was bright,
Oh how I remember the cool breeze
Of midnight air that swept us homeward;
You touched my hand with your fingers,
And there we clutched in stride—
Onward, homeward, yet so slowly we paced.
When the night light was bright,
Our youth tormented us without
Conscious thought of time passing.
When the night light was bright,
We were in the dark privacy
Of each other’s world;
Nothing beyond penetrated our attention
Thereof fixed.
When the night light was bright,
We thought it would shine forever,
For us.

NOSTALGIA IV

It was a time to remember,
Of romance galore and unforgettable
Memories of adult images in the eye of a child;
It was a time of Black shoes shined,
And quality hats so fine;
Of men’s coat and tie,
And women’s stockings up high;
Of romantic touch dance,
And navy-blue gabardine pants;
It was a time of hard work at less pay
And nightly prayers of appreciation each day;
It was a time to remember in June and
December, when things were quite simple;
A time when people had time and mind
To love much more;
A time when people had time and mind
To be at peace with themselves.

QUINTINA

There was a young girl
Named Quintina you see;
A bright child of 8 with
A smile of glee;
After years of my absence
She grew up to be
A beautiful woman and
Fine lady;
With courage, class, and grace
From Thee,
She exuded a countenance
Of sweet femininity;
Quintina, smile for the world to see;
Quintina, please smile again for me.

LIE DOWN

Lie down and feel yourself in our presence;
Let the ocean roar in the peacefulness of
Your ear;
Let the sand tickle your back and the sun
Wash your face.
Let us think of nothing except our feelings
For ourselves and this little world’s
Moment.
Lie and let life’s air bring meaning to our
Souls that we may breathe such
Memories forever.

WEAR A WHITE DRESS FOR ME

In the sunset of your womanhood,
Wear it for me;
Memories of innocence and coy,
Of private moments of our genuineness,
Spontaneity, and naive joy.
Wear it for me in my mind’s eye,
Of images in the sunlight and
Unrestrained freedom in the shade
Of the old oak tree.
Wear a white dress for me in the sunset
Of your womanhood—so I will know the
Purest image of my greatest love;
That I will always know you as the sacred
Temple of my life-long and devoted trust.

BEFORE WE LOVE

Before we love to love’s height,
Wash each other’s image we must
In sensual grace of our eyes’ sight;
Breathe each other’s natural scent
We should in the blow of evening air;
Touch we must with gentle care;
Hear we can of our other’s breath
Upon the softness of a neck’s rest;
Before we love to love’s height,
Romance we must the other’s self.

SHE CAME AT 5

She washed herself in his image at noon
And brought herself to him at five;
The natural scent of her told of a day’s work
Under the shroud of cream and perfume;
A mixture that aroused the privacy of his
Heaven so patiently anticipated;
Four walls and one wait for the appearance of
Love’s greeting; to see, to touch, to embrace
The energy and essence of his sweetest hope,
His sustaining thought, his fondest dream,
His greatest love, his sole source of life;
His woman, his lady.

LOVE HAS COME

He came into her so gently, as he did
To her;
Her presence was with courage but deep
Exhilaration of an experience
Never felt;
They were one in ecstasy atop a mountain,
Together, they realized a shyness and the
Downhill awkwardness of separation;
However, a deep fulfillment of a dream
Anticipated and complete;
They relaxed, she on his arm and he against
The softness of her;
Her breath whispered to his ear,
“I love you”; and he replied,
“I love you too.”

TOUCH ME, WILL YOU?

It’s been long, too long;
So will you touch me with the
Tender tips of your fingers aglow,
And let the heat of love’s past
Set free the spirit of our fiery
Passion’s remains?
Touch me now, in the privacy of
This day’s secret love and space,
That we may live life’s life as
We so once did.
Come to me so slowly and walk
Your image so larger into my eyes’ view
And the whole of you into my arms’
Embrace.
It’s been long, too long,
So will you touch and we touch
As we once loved before?

POETICA SENSEROTICA

And she spoke of love’s passion:
“Come with me dear love;
Come within me as one,
And let my warmth for you alone
Puncture deeply to the tip of your
Soul’s yearning for me; and, as you wish,
Allow me to come so tenderly
And peacefully as a lamb to the gentle
Thrust of your lion’s passionate
Growl and groan of sweet sensual
Satisfaction;
Let me touch, breathe, and sense
Completely the acclamation and
Celebration of this our romantic love.”
And he replied:
“I will come to you my lone love awaiting,
And into love’s chamber of your
Sensual pleasures so as to pay in burning
Passion our time’s debt of love come due;
Trust me to lay upon you my long-held
Desire and set free the tension of love to
Bloom forth your hidden orchids asleep;
Let me come with the rhythm of your
Sweet kitten’s purr and as a lion’s gentle
Touch to your loin’s tender flank— 
Such as to set our hearts and souls afire,
Forever, in this life of our love,
And in this love of our life’s remain.”

MY PLEASURE IS YOUR PLEASURE

Dear love, my pleasure is to give you
Pleasure,
For that is the light of my life.
The sharing of the desire you evoke in me,
I trust, will burn free the shackled joys
Of your most precious and priceless reservoir
Of sensations longing.
So timely now, so fervently now,
Let us come into each other’s gentle arms,
And set aloft and aflame the honey of our
Ripened fruits.
In this natural and spiritual attraction of ourselves,
Let us trust our future hopes and happiness
Untold to our romantic desires’ yearning.

I WANT YOU

We sat juxtaposed for a purpose other
Than the unforeseen;
Our eyes touched out of courtesy, but
Quickly locked from the magnetism
Of our own sensual vibrations;
We trembled and struggled to control and
Sequester our feelings for the other;
Our bodies filled each other’s eyes in
Subtlety and brevity between interludes
Of trying to look unassuming;
Our gender’s scent betrayed the truth of each
Other’s desire to our deep breath’s yearning;
Our skin flinched and our muscles tensed
As we waited for separate buses,
Hoping they would, this time, be late;
We parted so painfully, knowing that
We must see each other again, but
Wondering so desperately
“How” and “when.”

LOVE BONE’S WISH

Let me touch you with the tender
Tip of a love bone and explore sites
Of honey along the darkest chamber
Of your hidden love asleep;
Let me awaken the deepest senses
Of life’s heights of two, connected in
A whole thought of this love’s moment;
Let my love bone embrace my bones
To your bones’ embrace for this timely
Moment and experience of our irresistible
Love.
